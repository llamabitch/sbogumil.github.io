My name is Shey Bogumil, and I am an actress local to Los Angeles, CA. I have my BA in Theatre Performance and over a decade of improvisation experience. Currently, I am writing a television series about learning disabilities in the education system. I aim to employ more people with disabilities in the entertainment industry and educate the general population about some of the disabilities you can't see.
